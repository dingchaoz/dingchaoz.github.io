US Census map

Note:
the coordinated view can't show the 2nd layer of treemap, and it seems becuase the
treempap.children is defined by libs\d3.min.js or d3.js, while in the single view
file treemap.children is defined by d3org.d3.v2.js, there is a conflict using
the multiple js libraries-- need to fix that-- or use a different coordinated view
system like http://bl.ocks.org/dukevis/6768900 which does not use the course lib
