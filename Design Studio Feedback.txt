We worked with Jordan our TF in the project idea selection, and visualiztion design; Jordan provided valuable feedback and helped us advance our project.

Due to one of our two team members is extension student located in Indiana,
we were not able to hold a design studio as a team on campus.

We will gather as muh as possible feedback continuously from TF and other channels if available.
